Course CS 6240 (Section 01)

This course covers techniques for analyzing very large data sets. We introduce the MapReduce programming model and the core technologies it relies on in practice, such as a distributed file system. Related approaches and technologies from distributed databases and Cloud Computing will also be introduced. Particular emphasis is placed on practical examples and hands-on programming experience. Both plain MapReduce and database-inspired advanced programming models running on top of a MapReduce infrastructure will be used.


This repository contains all the assignments of the course.
